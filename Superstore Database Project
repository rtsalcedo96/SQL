-- end of database query, upcoming code/comments is my project

-- The folowing project is data query from superstore table simulating real life data questions when working with similar institutions such as Costco, Amazon, Walmart, TJ Maxx, Target, CVS, Dollar General, or Home Depot.

-- prompt #1) Write a SQL query that orders the items by price.

SELECT item_name
, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price
;

-- prompt #2) Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices, like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count.

-- for this prompt I will consider a simple aggregate of finding out: "how much money would a customer spend if they bought 1 of each item at this store?" 

SELECT SUM(price)
FROM superstore
;

-- prompt #3) Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies".

-- for this prompt I will simply consider a more specific aggregate of prompt #2, where I want to find out what is the total amount spent if a customer were to buy 1 of each item in the store's "Kitchen Supplies" section

SELECT SUM(price)
, category
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
;

-- prompt #4: custom prompt: "What are the top 3 highest rated products the store has?"

SELECT item_name
, average_rating
, stock_quantity
, category
FROM superstore
ORDER BY average_rating desc
LIMIT 3
;

-- the scenario behind my custom prompt was if a CEO/Manager wanted to inquire about the store's best selling items, from which category they come from (to potentially add more items to those best-selling categories), and if the store has a proper amount of product stocked to meet demand.
