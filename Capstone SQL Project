-- The following project utilizes a large database called "chinook" which I downloaded and connected to SQLite Studio
-- The purpose of this project is to showcase a comprehensive knowledge and application of real-world questions using core SQL concepts

--1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country != 'USA'
;

--2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil'
;

--3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cus.FirstName, cus.LastName, inv.InvoiceID, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers cus
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cus.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil'
;

--4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees 
WHERE title LIKE '%Sales%'
;


--5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
;

--6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cus
ON inv.CustomerId = cus.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cus.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
;

--7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT emp.LastName AS emp_ln
, emp.Firstname AS emp_fn
, cust.FirstName AS cus_fn
, cust.LastName AS cus_ln
, cust.Country
, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
;

--8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
;

--9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
;

--10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
;

--11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT ar.name AS Artist, t.Name AS Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID
;

--12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId
;

--13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
;

--14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1
;

--15. Find out how many unique customers are from the USA

SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'USA'
;

--16. What are the names of those unique customers from USA

SELECT DISTINCT FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'USA'
;

--17. Who is the general manager of the store and when were they hired?

SELECT LastName, FirstName, Title, HireDate
